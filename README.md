# 2AHealth
Central documentation for the 2A health apps.

*2AHealth* is a suite of applications revolving around nutrition, exercising and general health. This repository does not correspond to any particular app in the collection, but is rather a central register for everything that connects these different apps, making them consistent and coherent. This includes colour schemes, icons, layout guidelines, accessibility guidelines, interoperability etc.

All apps in the *2AHealth* suite are written using [Flutter](https://flutter.io) and their designs follow the [Material Design Guidelines](https://material.io).
