# 2A Health
Central documentation for the *2A Health* suite.

*2A Health* is a suite of applications revolving around nutrition, exercising and general health. This repository does not correspond to any particular app in the collection, but is rather a central register for everything that connects these different apps, making them consistent and coherent. This includes colour schemes, icons, layout guidelines, accessibility guidelines, interoperability etc.

All apps in the *2A Health* suite are written using [Flutter](https://flutter.io) and their designs follow the [Material Design Guidelines](https://material.io).

## Brand

The *2A Health* suite, being the first from 2A, defines the first version of the brand's identity. The 2A brand is identified by its logo in a colour-agnostic fashion. Each app in the suite has its own app-specific version of the logo and a colour theme, but the 2A brand itself has no colour theme, and neither does the *2A Health* suite.

For each individual app, the colour theme is consistent throughout platforms, devices and products.

## The apps in a nutshell

### 2A Quench

A water-intake logger and reminder app and the first in the suite.

### 2A Run

A running logger and planner app. Draw intended paths on maps and save them. Get information about their lengths, make notes, log partially traversed paths, track improvement over time.

### 2A HIIT

High-intensity interval training builder and timer, with sharing functionality and very customisable.

### 2A Planner

Training planner integrated with calendar apps as well as other *2A Health* apps, automatically helping to enforce customisable rules (e.g. run at least 2x a week, run at least 10km a week, never go climbing 3 days in a row etc).
